### Projects 

| Project | Description | Originated | Author(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [United States Broadband Availability](https://github.com/aelluminate/united-states-broadband-availability) | This project analyzes broadband availability in US counties (October 2020). We explore distribution patterns and use machine learning to classify availability (high, medium, low) based on FCC data. | [ðŸ”— Check it out](https://github.com/Cless41/SFTDSNLAB-FINALS) | [Angelo RR Fernando P. Oppus](https://github.com/Cless41), [Jainie Angel Jhem M. Yumul](https://github.com/JAINIE12), & [Rafael Enrique T. Sabile](https://github.com/HAU-RafaelES) |
| [Glacier Mass Balance Over Time](https://github.com/aelluminate/glacier-mass-balance-over-time) | This project analyzes historical glacier mass balance data to understand the impact of climate change. Findings show a decline in mass balance, with Decision Tree and Random Forest models most accurate in predicting future trends. | [ðŸ”— Check it out](https://github.com/MJGuevarra17/Lising_Guevarra_CPE402_FinalExam) | [Martin Joseph G. Guevarra](https://github.com/MJGuevarra17) & [Justine N. Lising](https://github.com/JustineDJANGO29) | 
| [Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity Analysis](https://github.com/aelluminate/nutrition-physical-activity-obesity-analysis) | This project analyzes US health data to understand how diet, physical activity, and demographics impact obesity rates. Findings show correlations between lower activity, poor diet, and higher obesity. Models using this data achieved 100% accuracy in predicting obesity risk, highlighting potential public health interventions. Further analysis is needed to confirm generalizability of these findings. | [ðŸ”— Check it out](https://github.com/Jerald011003/BRFSS-Analysis) | [Barlo R. Ordiales](https://github.com/BarloBRO) & [Jerald Bagsic](https://github.com/Jerald011003) | 
| [Air Quality of NYC](https://github.com/aelluminate/air-quality-of-nyc) | This project analyzes NYC air quality data to identify common pollutants and explore spatial/temporal trends. It utilizes various regression models, with Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving the highest accuracy (95.58%) in predicting air quality values. Findings can inform strategies to improve public health and reduce air pollution. | [ðŸ”— Check it out](https://github.com/KushyKooo/Air-Quality-SOFTDSN-FINALS) | [Rikshawn Danille V.
