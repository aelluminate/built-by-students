| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [United States Broadband Availability](https://github.com/aelluminate/united-states-broadband-availability) | This project analyzes broadband availability in US counties (October 2020). We explore distribution patterns and use machine learning to classify availability (high, medium, low) based on FCC data. | [ðŸ”— github.com/..](https://github.com/Cless41/SFTDSNLAB-FINALS) | [Angelo RR Fernando P. Oppus](https://github.com/Cless41), [Jainie Angel Jhem M. Yumul](https://github.com/JAINIE12), & [Rafael Enrique T. Sabile](https://github.com/HAU-RafaelES) |
| [Glacier Mass Balance Over Time](https://github.com/aelluminate/glacier-mass-balance-over-time) | This project analyzes historical glacier mass balance data to understand the impact of climate change. Findings show a decline in mass balance, with Decision Tree and Random Forest models most accurate in predicting future trends. | [ðŸ”— github.com/..](https://github.com/MJGuevarra17/Lising_Guevarra_CPE402_FinalExam) | [Martin Joseph G.
